# PoseGRAF: Geometric-Reinforced Adaptive Fusion...

![Overall framework of PoseGRAF](images/OverFramework.png)


---

## 📌 Introduction
PoseGRAF is a novel framework that addresses key challenges in monocular 3D human-pose estimation:

- **Dual Graph Convolution** – simultaneously processes joint and bone graphs under geometric constraints.  
- **Geometry-Aware Fusion** – explicitly models the relationships between bone directions and joint angles.  
- **Dynamic Feature Integration** – adaptively fuses positional and geometric features via attention.  
- **Topology-Enhanced Transformer** – injects anatomical constraints directly into the transformer architecture.

PoseGRAF achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and generalises well to in-the-wild scenarios.

## 🚀 Key Results
| Metric | Dataset / Protocol | Result |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **MPJPE** | Human3.6M (CPN detections) | **48.1 mm** |
| **P-MPJPE** | Human3.6M | **38.3 mm** |
| **PCK** | MPI-INF-3DHP | **87.2 %** |

PoseGRAF is robust to occlusion and fast motion.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training from Scratch

Logs, checkpoints and auxiliary files will be written to `./checkpoint`.

#### Human3.6M

```bash
python main.py --train --model PoseGRAF --layers 6 --nepoch 40 --gpu 0
```

## 🌄 In-the-Wild Demo

### 1 · Install FFmpeg

Download the latest FFmpeg build from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and ensure the executable is on your `PATH`.

### 2 · Create the Side-by-Side Comparison Video

```bash
# ❶ Convert 2D key-point renders to a video
ffmpeg -framerate 30 -start_number 0 -i "%04d_2D.png" -vf "scale=-2:872,fps=100" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p pose2D.mp4

# ❷ Convert 3D key-point renders to a video
ffmpeg -framerate 30 -start_number 0 -i "%04d_3D.png" -vf "scale=-2:872,fps=100" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p pose3D.mp4

# ❸ Concatenate the two videos horizontally
ffmpeg -i pose2D.mp4 -i pose3D.mp4 -filter_complex "hstack=inputs=2" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p pose_comparison.mp4
```
